# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`eliot.build` — is the build tool for the [Eliot language](https://github.com/robertbraeutigam/eliot),
written *in* Eliot. 

When reading or editing any `.els` file, use the `eliot-code` skill — it is the full language
reference. Eliot is total-by-default (no recursion/loops in user code), effects are written in
direct style, types are values, and there is one `Int` whose range is compiler-tracked
meta-information.

## Architecture

## Building and running (compiler CLI)

The build will eventually dogfood itself, but is not yet available. Compilation is driven by a sibling checkout of the Eliot
compiler (see `eliot.paths` for its location — `/home/robert/personal/eliot`), whose `examples.run`
Mill task auto-appends the `lang`/`stdlib`/`jvm` layer source roots. You pass this project's own
roots as positional arguments:

```bash
cd /home/robert/personal/eliot          # the compiler checkout
./mill examples.run jvm exe-jar -m eliot.test.Runner \
   /home/robert/personal/eliot-test/src \
   /home/robert/personal/eliot-test/test \
   -o /home/robert/personal/eliot-test/target
java -jar /home/robert/personal/eliot-test/target/Runner.jar   # runs the discovered tests
```

Argument ordering is strict (scopt): `-m <module>` must come **immediately after `exe-jar`**, before
the positional source roots (once positional roots are consumed the subcommand scope is lost and
`-m` errors as "Unknown option"). The output flag `-o <dir>` trails at the end. The module for `-m`
is **fully qualified** — `eliot.test.Runner`, not `Runner`.

Every source root that should contribute tests must be passed. Passing both `src` and `test` runs the
framework's own self-tests. A downstream project using this framework passes `src` (the framework)
plus its own test root instead.

### `eliot.paths` — LSP only

`eliot.paths` lists all source roots (this project's `src`/`test` plus the base/stdlib/jvm layer
roots, and the `compiler`-pool overlays). **Only the IntelliJ LSP reads it** — in the IDE, "Run main"
on `eliot.test.Runner` builds and runs with no arguments. The compiler CLI ignores `eliot.paths`
entirely and requires every root as an explicit path argument; the `examples.run` task above supplies
the layer roots, and you supply `src`/`test`. Keep `eliot.paths` in sync with the CLI invocation if
you change either.
